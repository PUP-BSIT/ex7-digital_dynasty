                I couldn't ask for better group mate in coding. 
                Her commitment to teamwork and willingness to 
                lend a hand whenever needed have been instrumental 
                in our success. -Bergado, Shamma
               </p>

               <p>
                I heartily endorse Mary Nicole She is an amazing developer 
                and coworker because of her strong work ethic, collaborative 
                spirit, and technical ability. -Reyes, John
               </p>

               <p>
                Coding alongside my group mates has been truly inspiring.
                Their passion for problem-solving and dedication 
                to excellence make every session rewarding. -Reyes, Paul

               Mary, my classmate, demonstrates a good grasp of coding, 
               though she's not an expert. I've seen her proficiency in various 
               languages and her confidence in solving coding challenges. 
               While she's not at a professional level yet, her dedication 
               and competence shine in our class projects, 
               making her a valuable team member. -Morcoso, Daisy
